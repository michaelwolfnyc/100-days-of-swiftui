#  README

Ugly, but functionality is there.

1.  Code rot already.  E.g. answer = "" and incrementQuestion() always paired, and incrementQuestion always uses questionList.count.
Possibly a class encapsulates that kind of stuff, and other state too?
2.  Game over screen, no possibility to quit, though apps don't allow that, so maybe not play again? button
3.  I'm sure multiple screens not supposed to be done with a state variable and an if statement!
