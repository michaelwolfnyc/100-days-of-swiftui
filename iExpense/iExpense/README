"For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections:
one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses.
This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means
being careful about how items are deleted!"

Failed on this challenge, but I know exactly how to fix it.  The current code
is the original project, and the commented code is the hard part of the challenge.
The cool working part is the "filter()" to get only the business or personal
items.  Also cool is the SectionOFTypeView to print out each sections separately
with no code duplication.  The broken part is that .onDelete calls removeItems().
The IndexSet passed in is for the *filtered* list, but then removeItems() deletes
from the unfiltered list.  It would be easy enough to have removeItems() know
the type, look at the index set to be deleted for that type, and convert it to
the index set of the original.  Or, equivalently, filter the original, get the
UUIDs corresponding to the index set, and delete *those* UUIDs.  I think that's
cleaner.

In any case, good enough for now.
